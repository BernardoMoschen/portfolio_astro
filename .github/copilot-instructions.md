## Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all React components
- Follow Material UI best practices and use the sx prop for styling
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Maintain responsive design with Material UI breakpoints
- Follow clean code principles with meaningful variable names

## Component Structure

- All React components are in `src/components/`
- Layout files are in `src/layouts/`
- Pages are in `src/pages/`
- Global styles and animations are in Layout.astro

## Key Conventions

- Ensure all components are mobile-responsive
- Use Material UI icons for consistency
- Global CSS animations are defined in Layout.astro, not in individual components
